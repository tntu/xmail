Xmail
=====

Send email the right way so it does not get flagged as SPAM. 
Most servers use a diffrent IP address to send email from then the IP of your domain and thus your emails get into SPAM folders or not att all in some cases of Yahoo! and MSN. 
This will send emails from your domain IP address. 
It might take 1-2 seconds more (if you use MX mode) to send it but it is worth it.
Use template to design your email.

* Your emails will not be marked as SPAM.
* If your emails did not even arrive to Yahoo! or MSN now they will.
* This is the way Google, Yahoo! and MSN best like emails to come to them.
